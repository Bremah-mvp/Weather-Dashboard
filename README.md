               WEATHER DASHBORAD APPLICATION.

 This is a weather application that lets you know the current and the next five days weather of any city 
 in the world.

 Are you planning to travel for holidays, work or any personal travel arrangements which could be a simple
 night date, find out your local weather and get to know how its gonna be the next five days so your
 arrangements dont get tampered with. This also has a default city weather shown when loaded..


                   EARLY STEPS/ BREAKING DOWN THE PROJECT REQUIREMENTS

This is a very important step that involves identifying all the tools you need and the scope of the project.
forexample looking for the weather API to use and structure all the steps your going to follow to get the work done.

            TOOLS USED TO CREATE THE APPLICATION

HTML
It is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser
I used html to design the structure or the first layout of the application

CSS
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.
I used css to add styles and coloring to make the application more attractive.

BOOTSTRAP
 One of the most import aspects of bootstrap it enables a Mobile First design.
Using the BootStrap framework helps make the design and final product a mobile friendly app from the beginning.
I used bootstrap to add more styles to the layout so the app can be even more atrractive and flexible.

JAVASCRIPT
IT is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it.
Used javascript to make the app dynamic and activate all the functionality so the app can perfom its designated job.

         HOW IT WORKS
Simply load the app on your computer or phone, after loading the application you select any desired city your interested
to know their current weather. Used my home town as the default weather east or west nothing bests Home..
After entering the city name in the input field, and press the search for desired city button.
The application will return to the user, the current day weather, and the next 5 days weather forecast for the same 
city.
The app also saves all previous city searches for quick access just incase the user wishes to revist the same search
only that it will still return the updated current weather and the next five days weather forecast..
 
 Application also enables you to enables you to clear all the recent city searches saved apart from my default Kampala city..
